ManiaLib framework
===================================================

*Work in progress*

ManiaLib Manialink is an object-oriented PHP framework for writing Manialink interfaces.
Compared to former version of ManiaLib, this is just meant to be a standalone package to build Manialink pages.
It can be used in any sort of projects, from Web frameworks (eg. ManiaLib) to server controllers (eg. ManiaLive).
It shares some common code with ManiaLib\Gui, but a lot was changed in naming an overall architecture.
